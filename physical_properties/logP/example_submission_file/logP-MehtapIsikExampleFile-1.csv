# PARTITION COEFFICIENT PREDICTIONS 
#  
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:  
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description. 
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers. 
# 
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing. 
# 
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty. 
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required. 
Category:
Physical
 
# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION 
# 
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication. 
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated. 
# Use as many lines and paragraphs of text as you need. 
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
