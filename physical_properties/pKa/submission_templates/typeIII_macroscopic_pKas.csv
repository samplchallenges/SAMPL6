# Submission Type III
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal yet informative name of the method used.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
Name:



# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software: 



# METHODS SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of detail should be at least that used in a publication.  
# Please include the values of key parameters, with units, and explain how any statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the "Method:" keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
