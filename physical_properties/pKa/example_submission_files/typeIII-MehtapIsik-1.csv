# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.
Predictions:
SM98,9.44,1.02
SM99,7.39,0.50
SM99,3.35,0.37


# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal yet informative name of the method used.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
Name:
Example method A


# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software: 
Example software 1, v1.0.1

# METHODS SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of detail should be at least that used in a publication.  
# Please include the values of key parameters, with units, and explain how any statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the "Method:" keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description. 
Method: 
To predict the pKa values, example method A was used, with all details described as follows: ...
The p1 parameter was set to 1, and the p2 parameter was set to 0. 
The uncertainty was estimated by calculating the standard error in the mean over 10 replicate calculations.
