# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Each submission (method) must have a completed `typeIII_macroscopic_pKas.csv` file for all molecules the prediction encompasses.
# For each molecule, report as many macroscopic pKas as your method predicts. 
# Add new lines for each predicted molecule.
# For molecules with multiple macroscopic pKas report each macroscopic pKa in a new line.
# Report pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional and encouraged. If it is reported, SEM should be reported to two decimal places (e.g. 1.02).
# For values for which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, macroscopic pKa, macroscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method: 
Epik predicted structures between pH 2-12 at intervals of 0.1 pH units, returning structures with predicted min probability of e^(-10KT).
All unique microscopic pKa values detected were converted to macroscopic pKa values using
equation 4.3 from DOI:10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00805.
