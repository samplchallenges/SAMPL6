Method: 
All simulations were performed with the pmemd.cuda program from
AMBER16.7. 

The guest molecules were noncovalently docked to the host molecule using the docking program of MOE 2016.08. The produced 
complexes were minimized under the Amber10:EHT force field in MOE. The systems were then prepared using the Leap module 
of AmberTools16 under the AMBER ff14SB and GAFF force fields. To create force field parameters, the geometry of the host 
was optimized using Gaussian 16 with the AM1 method. The geometry of guest 13 was optimized with the density functional 
method B3LYP implemented within Gaussian 16. The Lan2L2DZ basis set was used for the platinum atom and 6-31G(d) basis set 
was used for the rest of the atoms. The obtained AM1 Mulliken charges were used with the antechamber suite of Amber16 to 
generate AM1-BCC charges and parameters. Sodium or chloride counter ions, with parameters from Joung and Cheatham 
(10.1021/jp8001614), were added to neutralize the system. Each system was solvated in a 14.0 Å cube of TIP4P-Ew water 
beyond the solute and 150 mM sodium chloride.
 
The systems were relaxed under NVT conditions over six minimization procedures with decreasing restraints on the host 
of 500.0.00000, 200.0.00000, 20.0.00000, 10.0.00000, 5.0 kcal/mol(Å ^2).
The systems then were heated to 300 K over 30 ps. The temperature was kept at 300 K using Langevin dynamics and pressure 
was coupled to 1 atm using isotropic position scaling. Atomistic MD simulations were performed for 10 ns in triplicate. 
Nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 10.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the 
particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method, using default AMBER settings. SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds involving hydrogen, 
and the simulation time step was set to 2 fs. All simulations were performed with AMBER16.7. 
 
Cluster analyses were performed to identify the most representative structure for each host-guest complex. 
 
Quantum chemical calculations were carried out using ORCA 4.0 on each representative structure. Calculations were done using 
the B3PW91 density functional since B3PW91 has been shown to treat long-range covalent interactions well. To treat the use of 
exact exchange in the functional, the RIJCOSX approximation (10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036) is used with the def2 auxiliary 
basis set(10.1016/0009-2614(95)00621-A) to reduce the computational cost (CPU time, memory) associated with the number of atoms 
in the host system. The SMD solvation model (10.1021/jp810292n) was used to include solvated effects. The thermal corrections 
for all molecules are calculated at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory in Gaussian 16.
 
To extrapolate to the Kohn-Sham limit, the cc-pVnZ basis sets were used where n = D, T. The extrapolation scheme 
(10.1063/1.1465405) used was E(l_max) = E_CBS + A(l_max+1)exp(-B*sqrt(n_s)) where l_max is the maximum angular momentum function 
in the basis set, and n_s is the number of s functions in the basis set. 
 
The B-parameter is set to 5.5 in agreement with Jensen to have a two-point extrapolation scheme(10.1063/1.1465405). Since these 
are weak molecular interactions between host-guest binding and the abundance of  weak molecular interactions in biomolecules,
(10.1063/1.3641894) the Boys and Bernardi formula (10.1080/00268977000101561) for basis set superposition error (BSSE) is used 
for the host-guest complexes.
